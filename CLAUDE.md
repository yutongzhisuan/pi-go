# CLAUDE.md — pi-go

Guidance for coding agents working in this repo. Applies to Claude Code and to
pi-go's own agent; where the two differ, both are described.

## Work in a git worktree, not the primary checkout

**Do not make uncommitted edits in `/Users/dimetron/p6s/pi-dev/pi-go` and leave
them there.** The primary checkout has its branch switched frequently, and
`git checkout` discards uncommitted changes in tracked files without warning.
Work has been lost to this. A worktree gives each task its own working
directory and its own branch, so a switch in one cannot destroy another.

Create one before starting any task that edits tracked files:

```bash
git worktree add -b fix/<topic> .worktrees/fix-<topic> HEAD
cd .worktrees/fix-<topic>
```

Remove it when the branch is merged or abandoned:

```bash
git worktree remove .worktrees/fix-<topic>
git worktree list          # verify; prune stale metadata with `git worktree prune`
```

### Where worktrees live

Three conventions coexist. Match the one that fits who is doing the work.

| Creator | Path | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Human / Claude Code | `<repo>/.worktrees/<branch-with-dashes>` | `fix/…`, `feat/…` | Inside the repo; `.worktrees/` is gitignored |
| pi-go agent (`/run`, subagents) | `<repo>/.pi-go/tasks/<pathID>` | `pi-agent-<shortID>`, or the sanitized requested name | Created by `internal/subagent/worktree.go`; `.pi-go/` is gitignored |
| `arbor` tool | `~/.arbor/worktrees/pi-go/<name>` | matches dir name | External tool, listed here only so `git worktree list` output is not surprising |

`.pi-go/` and `.worktrees/` are both gitignored, so agent worktrees never show
up as untracked noise in `git status`.

### What pi-go's agent already does, and why it matters

`WorktreeManager.Create` (`internal/subagent/worktree.go:117`) **stashes
uncommitted changes before `git worktree add` and pops them afterwards**, with
a unique stash message so the pop is deterministic
(`stashMessage`, `popStashByMessage`). It does this because `worktree add` from
HEAD fails on a dirty tree.

The consequence worth knowing: if a pi-go subagent runs while you have
uncommitted work in the primary checkout, your changes take a round trip
through the stash. That is safe, but it is one more reason not to keep
long-lived uncommitted work in the primary checkout.

Agents marked `[worktree]` edit an isolated tree. Their edits do **not** land in
the caller's tree — ask for an explicit patch or file list to apply, or use a
non-worktree editing agent (`internal/tools/subagent.go:127-128`).

## Commits: all commits must be signed

**Rule: every commit must be cryptographically signed and carry a
`Signed-off-by` trailer.** There is no exception — not for merge commits, not
for reverts, not for WIP or "just this once". An unsigned commit is a broken
commit; fix it before pushing (see the pre-push hook below).

The signing command:

```bash
git commit -s -S -m "..."     # -s = Signed-off-by trailer, -S = sign
```

`-S` is redundant when config is honoured (`commit.gpgsign` and `tag.gpgsign`
are already `true`), but pass it explicitly so a commit fails loudly rather than
landing unsigned when config is missing or overridden. The `pre-push` hook
hard-fails any push containing an unsigned commit or one missing a matching
`Signed-off-by` trailer, so an unsigned commit cannot reach the remote.

Signing here is SSH-format, not GPG, through 1Password:

```
gpg.format       = ssh
user.signingkey  = ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza...
gpg.ssh.program  = /Applications/1Password.app/Contents/MacOS/op-ssh-sign
```

### Verify signatures by inspecting the raw object

**Do not use `%G?` to check.** `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` is not configured, so
signature *verification* cannot run: `git log --show-signature` errors with
`gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile needs to be configured and exist`, and `%G?` reports
`N` for correctly signed and unsigned commits alike. It is a verification gap,
not a signing failure, but it makes the obvious check useless.

Inspect the raw object instead — a signed commit has a `gpgsig` header:

```bash
git cat-file commit HEAD | grep -q '^gpgsig' && echo signed || echo UNSIGNED
git log --format='%h %(trailers:key=Signed-off-by,valueonly,separator=;) %s' -5
```

Configuring an allowed-signers file would restore `%G?`, and is worth doing:

```bash
echo "dimetron@me.com $(git config user.signingkey)" > ~/.config/git/allowed_signers
git config --global gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile ~/.config/git/allowed_signers
```

### Never use `--no-verify`

**Do not pass `--no-verify` to `git commit`, ever.** Not to unblock a failing
hook, not "just this once", not with a note in the commit message. There is no
case in this repo where it is the right answer.

`--no-verify` skips *all* hooks, including the signing path — so a bypassed
commit lands unsigned, and because `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` is unset (see
above) nothing will tell you. That is how `0714568`, `a8b243b` and `bcb6d26`
ended up with no signature.

The hook that usually tempts this is `golangci-lint`, which runs against the
**primary checkout** and so can fail on pre-existing issues in files a worktree
branch never touched (currently 10 `SA1019` deprecation errors in
`hack/test/mcp/`). When that happens, stop and report it — the fix is to clear
the unrelated lint failure or to have the user decide, not to bypass the hook.

## Never commit a GIF or a screen recording

**Recordings go on a GitHub release, never into git history.** A GIF of a test
run or a TUI session is large, write-once, and stale within a week — but every
revision of one is downloaded by every clone forever, and a blob cannot be
un-pushed without rewriting history for everyone. GitHub itself warns above
50 MiB and rejects a push above 100 MiB.

Attach one to a PR instead — the `vhs-e2e-gif` skill wraps this:

```bash
CAPTIONS='e2e: tool calls after the fix' \
  .claude/skills/vhs-e2e-gif/scripts/attach-gif-to-pr.sh 246 /tmp/e2e.gif
```

`.githooks/check-large-files` enforces it from both `pre-commit` (staged blobs)
and `pre-push` (blobs the push would upload), with two limits:

| What | Limit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.gif .gifv .apng .mp4 .m4v .mov .webm .mkv .avi .ogv .cast` | 1 MiB | Recordings belong on a release |
| Anything else | 10 MiB | Far below GitHub's 100 MiB hard reject; the largest non-media file in the tree is ~70 KiB |

The check runs twice on purpose. `pre-commit` catches it early, when unstaging
is the whole fix; `pre-push` is the last reversible moment for a commit that
reached the branch some other way — a rebase, a cherry-pick, another tool.

One path is grandfathered in the script's `allow_re`: `docs/screen/pi-go.gif`
(5.4 MiB), committed before the hook existed and referenced by nothing in the
tree. It should move to a release asset and take its allowlist entry with it.

If a file genuinely has to live in the tree, shrink it, or as a last resort:

```bash
PI_ALLOW_LARGE_FILES=1 git commit -sS -m "..."
```

**Do not reach for `--no-verify`** — it skips the signing hooks too, and lands
an unsigned commit (see above).

## Review with Codex: open the PR first, review on GitHub

**The PR is the review track.** Open it first, then have Codex post its review
directly to the PR as a formal GitHub review, then resolve findings in-thread.
This keeps every finding, fix, and resolution permanently linked in one place —
a local terminal dump of findings is lost context; PR comments are not.

The flow:

1. **Finish the branch and open the PR** (rules below). All gates — build,
   tests, lint, vet — still run *before* pushing; opening early does not skip
   them.
2. **Have Codex review and post to the PR itself.** In the environment tested on
   PR #237, the `codex-review` subagent and restricted sandbox modes could not
   reach `api.github.com` ("credential rejected", browser fallback denied).
   Run this from a clean, dedicated PR worktree because the required
   `danger-full-access` mode removes the filesystem boundary as well as the
   network restriction:

   ```bash
   cd <pr-worktree>
   codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access "Read-only code review of GitHub PR <N> \
   (repo dimetron/pi-go; current dir is the PR worktree, branch <branch>). Scope: \
   'git diff main...HEAD'. Then POST one formal GitHub review yourself using gh: \
   build inline comments for actionable findings, anchored to file+line, as a \
   JSON payload file in /tmp, \
   submit with 'gh api --input' against /repos/dimetron/pi-go/pulls/<N>/reviews \
   with event=COMMENT. Sign the body '— Codex review'. Do not modify tracked files. \
   Do not commit or push." > /tmp/codex-pr-review.log 2>&1
   ```

   Contract: read-only over tracked files (the `/tmp` payload file is fine),
   diff scoped to `main...HEAD`, one formal review signed "— Codex review", with
   inline file:line comments for every actionable finding. A no-findings review
   has no inline comments. Budget ~5 minutes; run the foreground command with a
   generous timeout, then verify `git status --short` is still empty.

   The `gh` credential inside Codex's process may still be rejected even with
   network open. If Codex cannot post, have it emit findings as text (`FILE:` /
   `VERDICT:` / explanation per finding). The caller must convert those findings
   into the same formal review payload and submit it to
   `/repos/dimetron/pi-go/pulls/<N>/reviews`; a top-level `gh pr comment` is not
   a substitute for the review.

3. **Resolve findings in their review threads**: fix accepted ones in normal
   signed commits pushed to the branch, reply to each inline thread with its
   resolving commit, and resolve the thread after verification. For a dismissed
   finding, reply in that thread with the reason before resolving it — never use
   an unrelated top-level comment or silently ignore a finding.

A finding is a claim, not a verdict: verify each against the code before
accepting or dismissing it. The review is an independent gate from tests, lint,
vet, and build; it does not replace any of them.

### Local vs GitHub review — when to use which

- **GitHub review (default)** for anything that becomes a PR: permanent track,
  inline line comments, resolvable threads, visible to humans later.
- **Local `codex exec` output (no posting)** for pre-PR sanity checks on
  uncommitted work-in-progress, or quick second opinions on a spec/design doc
  where there is nothing to anchor comments to yet. Do not let local-only
  reviews substitute for the on-PR review before merge.

### After the review: run govulncheck and post the result

**Once the review is resolved and before the PR merges, run `govulncheck`
against the branch and post the result as a PR comment.** It belongs after the
review rather than before because it is about what the branch *depends on*
rather than what it says, and a dependency added mid-review would otherwise go
unscanned.

```bash
make vulncheck        # govulncheck -format json ./... | go run ./hack/vulngate
```

The gate fails only on findings that name a fixed version — those are the ones
someone can act on. Findings with no released fix are printed and do not fail:
there is nothing to upgrade to, so failing on them would leave every build red
until an upstream maintainer cuts a release, and a permanently red check is one
nobody reads.

Post the scanner and DB versions along with the findings, because the answer is
only true for the database on the day it ran. If a finding does have a fix,
upgrade rather than explain it away — the gate is deliberately narrow so that a
failure always means "there is something to do".

Do not run `make check-cve` for this: it opens with `go mod tidy -v`, which
rewrites tracked files, and a check should not mutate the tree it is checking.

## Creating a pull request

When the user asks to create a PR, open the browser link to the PR after it is
created, and include **all pending changes** in the PR.

```bash
# Push the branch and create the PR with all pending (uncommitted) changes.
# Stage everything, commit, push, then open the PR in the browser.
git add -A
git commit -s -S -m "..."        # sign off and sign, per the rules above
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --fill --web        # --web opens the PR page in the browser
```

- **All pending changes**: stage and commit everything outstanding on the branch
  before creating the PR — do not leave uncommitted work behind.
- **Open the browser link**: after the PR is created, open the PR URL in the
  browser so the user can review it immediately. `gh pr create --web` does this
  automatically; if you create the PR without `--web`, open the returned URL
  yourself.

### Never link an agent session in a PR

**Do not put a `claude.ai/code/session_...` link — or any other agent session
link — in a PR body, title, commit message, or review comment.** A session link
hands anyone who can read the PR the entire transcript that produced it,
including whatever unrelated context happened to be in that conversation. That
is a wider audience than the PR, and it is not what a reviewer asked for.

A PR must stand on its own: what changed, why, and how it was verified. The
tooling that produced it is not part of the record.

This overrides the harness default. Claude Code is instructed to append a
session link to PR bodies and to commit messages; in this repo, leave it out —
`gh pr create --fill` inherits whatever is in the commit message, so the link
must not be there either.

## Build, test, lint

Go 1.27.0. Use the Makefile rather than raw `go` invocations where a target
exists:

```bash
make build          # build the binary
make install        # build + install to GOPATH/bin
make test           # == test-unit
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-e2e       # build-tagged
make test-all       # unit + integration + e2e
make test-coverage
make lint           # golangci-lint v2
make vet
make check-cve
```

## TUI output safety: never write to stdout/stderr

The interactive TUI runs on the terminal's alternate screen. **Any write to
stdout or stderr from inside the TUI corrupts the display** — stray `fmt.Print*`,
`log.Print*`, `os.Stdout.Write`, or `os.Stderr.Write` calls render as garbage
over the UI and break the session.

Rules:

- **Never** use `fmt.Print*`, `log.Print*`, `stdlog`, `os.Stdout`, or
  `os.Stderr` to emit diagnostics or output from code that runs while the TUI
  is active (agent loop, callbacks, hooks, commands, model/tool callbacks).
- **Route diagnostics through the session logger** (`m.cfg.Logger` /
  `logger.Logger`) instead — `Info`, `Error`, `Errorf`, etc. These write to the
  session log file, never the terminal.
- **Allowed TUI outputs** are the only sanctioned ways to surface text to the
  user: the chat transcript, `SystemNoticeCh` (short system notices like
  auto-compaction outcomes), and the TUI's own status/error rendering. If a
  message must reach the user, deliver it through one of these, not a raw
  stdout/stderr write.
- A panic handler may write to stderr only as a last resort before the process
  dies; it must never be used for routine logging.

When in doubt, grep for `Printf|Println|os.Stdout|os.Stderr|stdlog` in the
package you are touching and confirm every hit is either outside the TUI path
or routed through the session logger.

## Profiling

`pi --pprof true` serves `net/http/pprof` on `http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof`.
Scripts live in `.claude/skills/go-pprof/scripts/` (`pprof-snap.sh`,
`pprof-watch.sh`, `pprof-diff.sh`); all read `PPROF_URL` and take no required
arguments.

A single sample cannot distinguish churn from a leak. Establish drift with
`pprof-watch.sh` before diagnosing, and profile the app in the state being
complained about — an empty session and an aged one are effectively different
programs here.

Findings are tracked in `TODO.md` under `## PPROF`; the live-measurement
write-up is in `MEM_PPROF.md`. Both are gitignored, so they are local notes, not
shared state — do not assume a teammate can see them.

## Session history lookup

When the user asks to check a specific session (e.g. `260809-0249-c53d2-7561f`)
or review session history, search under **`$HOME/.pi-go/`** — that is the
session root, not the repo.

Sessions live in `$HOME/.pi-go/sessions/<session-id>/`, one directory per
session (`sessionsDir()` in `internal/cli/cli.go:766`). Each contains:

- `meta.json` — id, title, model, provider, workDir, timestamps, host info.
- `events.jsonl` — the full turn/event stream (user + assistant messages).
- `trajectory.atif.json` — the ATIF trajectory (agent tool-call trace).
- `branches.json` — session branch state.

Other useful files under `$HOME/.pi-go/`:

- `last-session.json` — metadata of the most recent session start.
- `history.jsonl` / `history` — command history.
- `log/` — runtime logs (check here when init or a run fails).
- `config.json` — default model and settings.
- `memory/` — semantic memory store.

Useful commands:

```bash
ls $HOME/.pi-go/sessions/ | grep <session-id>   # confirm a session exists
cat $HOME/.pi-go/sessions/<session-id>/meta.json
tail -n 50 $HOME/.pi-go/sessions/<session-id>/events.jsonl
```

The `session-stats` tool (`internal/tools/session_stats.go`) scans these
directories for anomalies; it defaults to `$HOME/.pi-go/sessions` and accepts a
`session_dir` override.

## Repo notes

- `TODO.md` and `MEM_PPROF.md` are gitignored (`~/.gitignore` has `**/TODO.md`).
- `TODO.md` numbering restarts per section, so duplicate item numbers across
  sections are expected and are not a bug to fix.
