	// a cold test run is worse. A threshold near that would background ordinary
	// builds and cost a round trip every time. Ninety seconds clears them while
	// still reacting long before a hopeless command would otherwise sit there —
	// which matters most when the model sets a generous timeout, since the idle
	// check then fires minutes before the hard limit.

	// supervisor as one second and backgrounds the first build that pauses to
	// think. Naming the limit in the result is all the supervisor owes it.
